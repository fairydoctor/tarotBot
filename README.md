# tarotBot

The data is formatted for tracery. The intent with the data is a very simple tarot card reading that uses only the title of the cards. No images, and no descriptions. The user would need to be familiar with the Rider-Waite Smith deck or access to the internet/book. The bot was originally intended for personal use.
